# Owl-Post Authors
Owl-Post was created by the University of Florida and their
CTS-IT Team to help manage RDF Triples used in the VIVO system.

Here is an invetiably incomplete list of our beloved contributors.
These are all the people who have contributed code, knowledge, patience,
bug requests, among other things, to this project.

Naomi Braun (inventor@inventor.com) Inventor
Matthew J. McConnell (devmattm@gmail.com) Contributor
Patrick F. White (pfwhite@gmail.com) Contributor
Kevin S. Hanson (kshanson@gmail.com) Contributor
Chis P. Barnes (senrabc@gmail.com) Contributor

Owl-post would not be where it is today without their help!

An extra big THANK YOU goes to:

   Chris Barnes and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute for
   letting this project be open source and giving us the resources to do it.
